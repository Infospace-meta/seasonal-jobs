          Seasonal jobs and Youthfund have signed a Partnership Agreement aimed
          at promoting youth participation in agriculture through the mentorship
          and skills transfer program known as 'Bring it Home!'. The program
          involves Kenyan youths working on agricultural farms in the UK under
          the supervision of experts, and subsequently returning home to invest
          in similar local projects.

          We know opportunity for employment in East Africa is very restricted &
          will be for the foreseeable future. All East African countries are
          suffering high debt, reduced revenue, hesitant investments, growing
          population & lack of employment opportunities.
